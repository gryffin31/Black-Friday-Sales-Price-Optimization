**Goal:** Achieve Price Optimization for Black Friday Sales

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, matplotlib, seaborn

## Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values:** Imputed missing values in Product Categories using mean values.
- **Label Encoding:** Converted categorical attributes like Gender, Age, City Category into numerical values.

## Price Optimization Approach
1. **Data Exploration:** Analyzed 550,000 sales transactions to understand attribute impact on purchase prices.
2. **Feature Importance:** Determined crucial attributes using Decision Tree and LightGBM models.
3. **Model Training:** Employed models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Lasso.
4. **Comparison & Selection:** Evaluated models based on MSE and cross-validation scores to choose the best-performing model.
5. **Optimization Strategy:** Utilized the winning LightGBM model for price optimization.

## Key Findings
1. **Attribute Insights:** Explored attributes like User ID, Gender, Age, Occupation, City Category.
2. **Missing Values Handling:** Addressed missing data in Product Categories, ensuring accurate model training.
3. **Effective Modeling:** Identified LightGBM as the top-performing model for purchase price prediction.
4. **Optimized Prices:** Leveraged the winning model to achieve price optimization for Black Friday sales.

## Conclusion
This project delves into price optimization using machine learning, exploring data insights, preprocessing steps,
effective modeling, and achieving optimized purchase prices for Black Friday sales.
